# GPU Monitor

Fun thing to watch gpu usage on cluster. Flask-based webapp to show GPU occupation and usage statistics collected via SSH and nvidia-smi.

The server regularly parses `nvidia-smi` to check GPU usage and present free and used GPUs. It logs usage to some cache and shows usage statistics per user and their respective power usage and CO2 footprint.

## Usage
First, adapt `config.py` or write a custom `config.json` and pass it via `--config config.json`.

Run either with your username and password:
```
export GPUMONITOR_USER='<your_user>'
export GPUMONITOR_PASS='<your_password>'

python -u server.py
```

or with a private key:
```
export GPUMONITOR_USER='<your_user>'
export GPUMONITOR_PASS='<private_key_passphrase>'

python -u server.py
```

The `process_filter` let's you add a regex to filter for only specific processes, e.g. `python.*` could be an easy way to only look for python jobs and ignore window managers etc.

And navigate to your hosted web-app :)

## Notes
We currently assume single processes per GPU for display purposes.

## Requirements
It needs
```
flask
lxml
paramiko
pandas
```
